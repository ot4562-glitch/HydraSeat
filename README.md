# HydraSeat

HydraSeat is a Windows local gaming multiseat project focused on running **two independent local gaming Seats in one interactive Windows session**.

> **Licensing note:** the upstream README has declared MIT since the initial project commit, but the repository currently contains no `LICENSE` file. Release packaging therefore keeps project licensing as an explicit unresolved blocker until the upstream maintainer confirms or restores the intended license text.

> **Project status:** v1 release-candidate engineering branch, not a GA release. The current code builds and passes the automated suite, and the canonical host IPC has been smoke-tested on real Windows hardware. That does not replace two-Seat physical isolation, representative real-game, clean-machine, reboot/recovery, production-signing, or licensing evidence.

## Product model

A **Seat** is one independent local gaming station. A Seat may own a display, keyboard/mouse, controller, audio endpoint, active game process tree, target window, and other runtime resources.

HydraSeat keeps these concepts separate:

- **Player** — the person/profile using a Seat;
- **Seat** — the local hardware/runtime boundary;
- **Game** — a user-facing/catalog identity;
- **LaunchTarget** — the executable/launcher contract HydraSeat can actually start and own.

The v1 target is exactly two active Seats. Stopping, restarting, or changing Seat 1 must not tear down Seat 2, and vice versa.

## Architecture direction

HydraSeat is converging on one runtime-authority model:

            v
      bounded host IPC
            |
            v
      hydra_host.exe
      SessionController
       /            \
      v              v
 SeatRuntime 1   SeatRuntime 2
      |              |
      +-- process    +-- process
      +-- window     +-- window
      +-- input      +-- input
      +-- controller +-- controller
      +-- audio      +-- audio
      +-- rollback   +-- rollback
```

`hydra_host.exe` is the sole runtime authority on the reviewed v1 path. Each `SeatRuntime` owns only its Seat-local mutable state. `HydraSeat.exe` is an IPC client: the dependency-free Win32 release UI commits stable hardware assignments, performs explicit controller pairing, and launches/stops each Seat through the canonical host instead of constructing process-local runtime authority.

Core rules:

- exact ownership instead of process-name/window-title guessing;
- stable hardware identity instead of enumeration order;
- runtime PIDs/HWNDs/handles are never persisted as durable identity;
- missing or ambiguous isolation fails closed;
- risky Windows mutations require targeted capture, verification, rollback, and safe-state verification;
- compatibility work stays at the runtime edge and must not become UI or global runtime authority.

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and the stricter [Collaboration Contract](docs/COLLABORATION_CONTRACT.md).

## Current implementation snapshot

The current release-candidate branch contains the two-Seat configuration model, stable display/keyboard/mouse/controller identity, connection-scoped UI leases, generation-scoped `SessionController` / `SeatRuntime` ownership, exact process/window claims, host-owned launch/stop, Windows audio routing, and the x64 Gate-C external session/bridge path.

The Win32 UI is the reviewed default release UI. Qt remains an opt-in development UI and is disabled by default so release payloads do not silently depend on whatever Qt runtime happens to be installed on the build machine.

The dated breakdown is maintained in [Current Status](docs/STATUS.md). Future sequencing is in [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Safety and non-goals

HydraSeat is for local PC gaming. It is not intended to become:

- remote desktop or cloud gaming software;
- an enterprise VM or office multiseat manager;
- a DRM, anti-cheat, authentication, protected-process, or deliberate single-instance bypass;
- a system that silently changes global Windows state when Seat-local isolation cannot be proven.

Unsupported or ambiguous scenarios should be reported as unsupported rather than hidden behind a global fallback.

## Build prerequisites

- **OS:** Windows 11 x64 is the v1 release target; Windows 10 remains experimental in the release-scope contract;
- **Target process architecture:** x64 only for the reviewed v1 Gate-C path;
- **Compiler:** a C++20-capable Windows toolchain. The current local RC evidence was produced with MinGW-w64; an MSVC release build should still be qualified before GA;
- **Build system:** CMake 3.20+;
- **Windows SDK/APIs:** Win32 Raw Input, SetupAPI, DXGI, HID/XInput and related APIs;
- **Qt 6:** optional development UI only. Enable it explicitly with `-DHYDRA_ENABLE_QT_UI=ON`; the reviewed release UI does not require Qt.

Typical MSVC configuration:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```
