HydraSeat release artifact preflight fixture note

The release-artifact self-test creates all artifact bytes in a temporary directory.
It uses deterministic PE-shaped test bytes and an unsigned PowerShell fixture only to
exercise manifest/checksum/SBOM/provenance mechanics. The reviewed package contract now
includes the package-only HydraSeatSetup.exe bootstrapper while keeping the installed-owned
set separate; installer_package_contract.json freezes that distinction. These bytes are
never production artifacts, signing evidence, clean-machine evidence, or release qualification.

No file from C:\HydraSeat\references is copied, imported, or treated as a dependency.
The current reviewed release policy declares zero bundled third-party redistributables;
that must change only through an explicit reviewed release/dependency decision.
